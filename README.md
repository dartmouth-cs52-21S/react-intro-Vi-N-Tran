## What Worked Well
I think the instruction was very clear, which makes it easy for me to understand what I need to do. Additionally, there are also explanations on what each plug-in or download does, which makes the project clear to me

## What Didn't
I ran into a small problem which is I didn't enable ESlint, which took a bit of googling to figure out because I thought my code was incorrect, but it was just a click of a button fix.

## Extra Credit
typescript set up
